### README

I began this Hack-A-Thing with the intention of diving into Unity 3D and learning more about the language and technology. I found a great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXNjNcqW4kY) that shows how to build an [Augmented Reality Maze](http://www.instructables.com/id/Augmented-Reality-Tutorial-for-Beginners-With-Vufo/). I began working on the tutorial and getting familiar with Unity, but continually ran into errors that made it difficult for me to progress. One such error was the inability of the camera to track the Image Target that I had set up. I am yet to figure that one out but I soon will!

As a result, with an interest in actually completing a tutorial, I moved onto an [AR Kit Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eD7vveyPWQ) that walked through how to set up an AR Scene for iOS and how to place objects in the dimensions around the camera. I followed the tutorial to its final product, which is a simple game using AR.

I am very interested in the possibilities of Augmented Reality, and I am sure that there are several amazing products that can be built using the tech. It was great getting an introduction to the technology through this Hack-A-Thing, and I am sure I will be using it going forward. I will soon get over the hitch that I faced using Unity and will begin to become more experienced shortly.
